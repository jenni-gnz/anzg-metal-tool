Questions related to inputs	
What form of copper and zinc should I compare against the DGVs?	The DGVs are intended for use with dissolved metal concentrations (i.e., after filtration through 0.45µ m pore size filter). If used with measures of total metal concentration (i.e., samples acidified prior to filtration), the assessment will be conservative. This may be a useful initial step for some samples and locations, but in most cases, dissolved metals will be more useful. 
What if I don’t have information on pH, calcium, magnesium or DOC?	If no TMF data are available for your sample, you can first use the Tier 1 DGVs for a conservative assessment, and then estimate TMFs from existing data for a Tier 2 assessment. 
Because there is considerable uncertainty when extrapolating between samples and sites, a conservative percentile should be used to select that TMF value and calculate the bioavailability-adjusted GV.
The following approach is recommended:
1.	If TMF data are not available for a sampling event, TMFs could be estimated for that sample from existing data for the same site, using a conservative percentile (e.g., 25th percentile for DOC, calcium, magnesium; 75th percentile for pH). Use of BAGVs calculated from estimated TMF values should be considered a “screening level assessment” and the rationale for TMF value selection should be clearly documented.
2.	If there are no TMF data for that site, TMFs could be estimated from existing data from other sites, using a very conservative percentile (e.g., 10th percentile for DOC, calcium, magnesium; 90th percentile for pH). A lower percentile is recommended to reflect the higher uncertainty in extrapolating between sites, as TMF values can vary significantly. Again, use of BAGVs calculated from estimated TMF values should be considered a “screening level assessment” and the rationale for TMF value selection should be clearly documented.
Do you have to measure all TMFs each time copper and nickel are sampled?	The most robust assessment of toxicity requires measurements of DOC in each sample analysed for copper, and pH, calcium, magnesium and DOC in each sample analysed for nickel. These water quality variables tend to vary across time, even at the scale of an individual site. However, alternative approaches are suggested below where sample-specific TMF data are not yet available
Do you have to measure TMFs at each monitoring site?	The most robust assessment of toxicity requires measurements of pH, calcium, magnesium and DOC at each site because these water quality variables tend to vary between locations. If site-specific data are not available, a conservative estimate of the BAGV should be used.
What if TMF data are missing on some sampling occasions?	In some circumstances individual TMF data may be missing or were considered unreliable (e.g., a sample bottle broke during transport, or a pH meter failed calibration or validation). In this case, there are three options, each with different implications:
1.	Compare the metal concentrations for the affected sampling date to the Tier 1 DGV. This will likely be very conservative and may result in that sample measurement exceeding the DGV, when it might not have if it had been compared to a BAGV.
2.	Omit the metal measurements for dates on which TMF data are missing when assessing compliance with GVs. As this option will reduce the amount of data available for compliance and statistical comparisons, depending on how many samples are affected, it may not be acceptable. With this method there is also a potential risk of data being conveniently “lost” for sampling dates and times where metal concentrations are higher than usual.
3.	Estimate the TMF value for that sampling date/site. This option would be suitable where there are sufficient data available to estimate that TMF for that particular site and under similar conditions (season, flow). If this option is used, the TMF estimates should be conservative (e.g., a 25th percentile of the previously measured data) and a note included in the documented assessment that the comparison with the BAGV is based on estimated TMF data and is therefore indicative only.
Where there are few missing data, option 2 is recommended. Option 3 is recommended for most circumstances as this is a ‘middle-of-the-road’ option that uses the available data.

Can I use surrogates of TMFs?	A surrogate is a proxy measure for a variable of true interest that is too difficult or costly to measure directly on a routine basis. Hardness is a potential surrogate for calcium and magnesium though calcium to magnesium ratios can vary substantially between sites, particularly in Australia (see Gadd et al. 2024a).
For DOC, potential surrogates include spectrometric measures of water samples, such as UV absorbance at specific wavelengths, or fluorescence measurements (e.g., fDOM, fluorescence of
dissolved organic matter using in situ sensors). Dissolved iron has also been suggested as a DOC surrogate in the United Kingdom. These surrogate variables may be cheaper to measure over the long term than hardness or DOC (assuming that samples are already being collected for metals and/or in situ sensor data are available), or there may be historical data that could be used to indicate the likely hardness or DOC.
However, there is high variability in the relationships between DOC and potential surrogates (such as UV absorbance or fDOM) between sites. Relationships should be developed for every site, and may not be useful at all sites. If a site-specific relationship is developed, a conservative percentile estimate (e.g., 25th percentile) for DOC is recommended to provide a safety factor in calculating BAGVs (Gadd et al. 2023).

Questions related to applicability ranges	
What salinity are these DGVs applicable to?	The freshwater DGVs can be used in waters with salinity up to 2 ppt (ANZG 2018), after adjusting for water chemistry, if the pH, calcium, magnesium and DOC are within the applicable range for that metal. 
What are the application ranges for
DOC, pH, calcium and magnesium in the tool?
	The applicability range is defined from the models and data used to derive the BAGVs. The range represents the upper and lower boundaries of the water quality conditions in the chronic toxicity tests from which the linear regression models were developed. 
Table 2.2
Table 3.3:	Applicable range of TMFs for calculating ANZG freshwater copper and nickel DGVs.
Metal	pH	Calcium	Magnesium	Hardness	DOC
Copper	6-8.5	Not specified	Not specified	2-340	0-30
Nickel	6.0-8.0	3.7-88	3-72	22-516	0.5-17

How important are the applicable boundaries of the ANZG metals bioavailability tool?
	There is high uncertainty when using BAGVs outside the applicability range. It is important to consider whether this applies to one or more of the variables, how far the water chemistry of the water is from the upper or lower limit, and the frequency that these values are outside the range. BAGVs are not provided when the water chemistry is outside the model applicability range. 
When TMFs are consistently outside of the applicability range (e.g., low pH streams affected by acid mine drainage), site-specific GVs may need to be derived. 

Can a BLM be used if the TMFs are outside the DGV applicability ranges?
	Full BLM calculations, which extrapolate the range of the models, may be useful for sites which fall slightly outside the validation boundaries. This is because they are mechanistically based, so it can be assumed that the same mechanisms continue to operate to some extent. Predictions made outside of the validation boundaries will always be uncertain, and need to be treated with caution. Using BLMs in this manner should be done in conjunction with other lines of evidence as part of a multiple lines of evidence approach.
Note that the use of BLMs to assess metal bioavailability is not the same as using BLM-based guideline values (or criteria) provided in other jurisdictions. Those use different toxicity data that may not be relevant to Australia & New Zealand. 
Questions related to tool outputs	
Why is the HQ red coloured? 
	The HQ columns characterise the potential risk. When the dissolved metal concentration exceeds the BAGV, the HQ will exceed one (and be coloured red). A HQ value of 1 or greater identifies a potential risk, based on the selected level of protection. ANZG (2018) recommends that other lines of evidence are also used to assess risk.

What if a measured metal concentration is below the laboratory’s method
detection limit?	Metal concentrations in waterbodies may be below the limits of detection (censored data). At times coarser detection limits are used due to sample characteristics (like high salinity), which can also result in censored data. Methods for dealing with censored data (other than methods like substituting the limit of detection or half of the detection limit) are well advanced (Helsel 2012).
While there is less guidance on how to compare censored values to BAGVs under these conditions, the assessment is simple when the detection limit is lower than the BAGV – it can be concluded that the metal concentrations are below the BAGV and there is low risk of toxicity (at the level of protection of the BAGV used).

There may be cases where the detection limit is higher than the BAGV, especially at high levels of species protection (i.e., 99%) and under high bioavailability conditions. If the dissolved metals are below detection, it will be impossible to conclude whether a BAGV has been exceeded or not. This could be considered a special type of censored data and for assessments such as trends in exceedance over time, statistical methods are available to account for this, and a statistician should be consulted. These data should be included in any trend assessment as ignoring them could lead to incorrect conclusions about changes over time. Also, ANZG (2018) provide some guidance on what to do if a GV is below the limit of detection.
What if my background metal concentrations are higher than the BAGVs?	The BAGVs at low DOC and high levels of protection may be close to background levels of copper and nickel in a few locations. This will require care in water sampling to avoid sample contamination. Also, ANZG (2018) provide some guidance on what to do if background metal concentrations are higher than a GV.

Questions related to metal toxicity	
What type of water chemistry conditions are most sensitive for copper toxicity?
	Copper in waters with low DOC concentrations is likely to be more toxic to aquatic biota than in waters high in DOC. 
Extremes of pH can also increase toxicity.

What type of water chemistry conditions are most sensitive for nickel toxicity?
	Nickel in waters with low DOC concentrations is likely to be more toxic to aquatic biota than in waters with high DOC.
The combination of high pH and low hardness also increases nickel toxicity.

How will metal toxicity be affected in very soft waters?
	Hardness cations (Ca and Mg) can reduce the toxicity of metals, so lower hardness waters can result in higher metal toxicity. However, for metals that bind very strongly to DOC (e.g. copper) hardness cations can also reduce metal-DOC complexation so softer waters may not be more toxic for copper.

How will toxicity be affected in acidic waters?
	Acidity (protons) can reduce metal toxicity in a similar manner to that caused by hardness cations, so lower pH conditions can tend to reduce toxicity. However, low pH can also increase the chemical availability of metals in the solution, which could increase toxicity in some circumstances. In natural waters, low pH is often associated with low hardness and metals in these waters are often considered to be relatively toxic.

How will toxicity be affected in soft, acidic waters?	Metals in soft acidic waters can be very toxic and any predictions made for such waters would represent an extrapolation for more than one parameter, consequently making the results more uncertain. Site-specific GVs would be recommended.

How will toxicity be affected in very hard waters?
	Hardness cations (Ca and Mg) can reduce the toxicity of metals, so metals will tend to be less toxic in hard waters. However, there is often a limit to the protective effect at high water hardness. BAGVs calculated with calcium and/or magnesium concentrations held at the upper limit will generally be reliable, provided that the hardness is not extreme (i.e. more than twice as high as the upper limit threshold).
For metals which bind very strongly to DOC (e.g. copper), high hardness can also reduce copper-DOC complexation. 
How will toxicity be affected in high pH waters?
	Acidity (protons) can reduce metal toxicity in a similar manner to that caused by hardness cations, so higher pH conditions can increase metal toxicity (because there are fewer protons in solution). High pH can also promote the formation of inorganic-metal complexes, which decreases metal toxicity. Which process dominates toxicity, and thus affects the direction of toxicity when pH increases, is dependent on the metal and species of biota.

How will toxicity be affected in high pH hard waters?
	High pH (>8.5) hard waters lie outside the applicability range of the models, and can represent high bioavailability conditions for some metals, especially where DOC concentrations are low.

How does DOC affect metal toxicity?	Because of the co-variation that is commonly observed between pH and hardness in surface waters, the dominant bioavailability-modifying effect is usually that of DOC. DOC complexes dissolved metals and therefore reduces their bioavailability and toxicity. This effect is greatest for copper. Sites with low DOC concentrations will generally be more sensitive than similar sites with higher DOC concentrations, although there can be exceptions depending on DOC source and quality.

How will toxicity be affected in high DOC waters?
	High DOC concentrations generally reduce toxicity for all metals, although the degree of any additional effect is metal-dependent.
