The Metals Bioavailability Tool helps you estimate potential risks to freshwater aquatic environments posed by some dissolved metals after considering bioavailability.

You should use the Metals Bioavailability Tool in the context of the guidance provided about <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/guideline-values/default" target="_blank"> metal bioavailability, the Tiered Assessment Framework and the Metals Bioavailability Tool</a>
on the Australian & New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh & Marine Water Quality (ANZG) website.

You can use the Metals Bioavailability Tool at Tier 2 of the ANZG <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/guideline-values/default" target="_blank"> Tiered Assessment Framework</a>
to help assess potential risks to your waterbody.

The Metals Bioavailability Tool can calculate:

- **Bioavailability-adjusted guideline value** (BAGVs) - a default guideline value adjusted for metal bioavailability.
- **Bioavailable metal concentration** estimate - the concentration of a metal that is estimated to be bioavailable in the sample or at a site.
- **Hazard quotient** - is the metal concentration divided by the BAGV.
