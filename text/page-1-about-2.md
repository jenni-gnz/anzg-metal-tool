4. Metal concentrations are **required** if you want to estimate the bioavailable metal concentration,
or calculate a **Hazard Quotient**. 

5. You *may* include any other information such as:
* Site name 
* Stream name
* Date and/or time
* Flow
No specific column labels are needed for these. The information will be included in your results file.

6. The tool will calculate guideline values at your requested level of protection. These are provided in a downloadable csv file, that includes your input data.

7. Where you have entered data about the measured concentrations of the metal(s), the following options can also be selected:
* bioavailable metal concentrations (for comparing to the tier 1 guideline values)
* hazard quotient. In the output a Hazard Quotient >1 is highlighted <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> (indicating a hazard).

8. Your results file will also indicate where guideline values cannot be calculated because DOC, pH, hardness, calcium and/or magnesium are outside the range of the bioavailability models. The results file will provide a reason in the notes column, and further explanation and guidance can be found in the <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alisonpang">User Guide</a>.
