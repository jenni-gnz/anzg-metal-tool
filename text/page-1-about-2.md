4. Other data *can* be supplied but are not essential. Water hardness and pH are not required to calculate copper DGVs, but if supplied the values will be checked to ensure the water is in the suitable range for the copper DGVs. Metal concentrations are **required** if you want to estimate the bioavailable metal concentration,
or calculate a **Hazard Quotient**. 

5. You *may* include any other information such as:
   - Site name (if you like)
   - Stream name
   - Date and/or time
   - Flow  

No specific column labels are needed for these. The information will be retained in your results file.  &nbsp;

6. The tool will calculate BAGVs at your requested level of protection. These are provided in a downloadable csv file, that includes your input data.  

7. Where you have entered data about the measured concentrations of the metal(s), the following options can also be selected:
   - an estimate of the concentration of bioavailable metals (for comparing to the tier 1 DGVs)
   - hazard quotient (HQ). HQ values > 1 will be highlighted <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span> (indicating a hazard)*  
  

8. Your results file will also indicate where GVs are not applicable because DOC, pH, hardness, calcium and/or magnesium are outside the range of the bioavailability models. The results file will provide a reason in the notes column, and further explanation and guidance can be found in the <a href="user-guide.pdf">User Guide</a>.
