This tool estimates the potential risk to the aquatic environment posed by **copper**, **nickel** and **zinc** after considering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability">bioavailability</a>.

This tool has been developed to assist in implementation of the <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/about">ANZG</a> toxicant default guideline values (DGVs) within a <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/about">tiered risk assessment framework</a>. 

**Use the tool when your dissolved metal concentrations *exceed* the **<a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/about">tier 1 DGVs</a>**.**

The tool will calculate **sample-specific DGVs** based on the water chemistry information you provide. If you include metal concentrations, the tool will also estimate the bioavailable fraction of the metal, and calculate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_quotient">hazard quotient</a>.  Guideline values can be calculated for four levels of <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/resources/key-concepts/level-of-protection">species protection</a> (99%, 95%, 90% and 80%).

Guidance on the guideline values, the tiered approach to implementation, and a description of the science underpinning the tool's development is provided in links. 

Upload a comma-separated table (csv) with your water chemistry data or test the calculator with the example dataset provided. See "Instructions" below for more details.
