This tool estimates the potential risk to the aquatic environment posed by **copper**, **nickel** and **zinc** after considering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability">bioavailability</a>.

This tool has been developed to assist in implementation of the <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/about">ANZG</a> toxicant default guideline values (DGVs) within a <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/about">tiered risk assessment framework</a>. 

**Use the tool when your dissolved metal concentrations *exceed* the **<a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/about">tier 1 DGVs</a>**.**

The tool will calculate **sample-specific DGVs** based on the water chemistry data you provide. The water chemistry data needed depend on the metal DGVs you want to calculate and include pH, DOC, calcium, magnesium and water hardness; termed toxicity modifying factors (TMFs).

If you include metal concentrations, the tool will also estimate the bioavailable fraction of the metal, and calculate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_quotient">hazard quotient</a>.  DGVs can be calculated for four levels of <a href="https://www.waterquality.gov.au/anz-guidelines/resources/key-concepts/level-of-protection">species protection</a> (99%, 95%, 90% and 80%).

Guidance on the DGVs, the tiered approach to implementation, and a description of the science underpinning the tool's development is provided in links. 

Upload a comma-separated table (csv) with your water chemistry data or test the calculator with the example dataset provided. See "Instructions" below for more details.
