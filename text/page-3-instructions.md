In the table below, columns shaded blue will be used to calculate DGVs based on your selected options. &nbsp;
Errors are usually a column that is not present, or negative values (highlighted in red). Warnings (such as missing values or text) are highlighted orange.

If your data contains **errors**, the calculations will not proceed. Please correct the errors (check for spelling mistakes, and the correct capitalisation) and re-upload the file, or select different options (e.g., change metals).

**Warnings** will not prevent the calculations from progressing for this data set, but rows with missing or non-numeric data may be skipped.  &nbsp; DGVs will be calculated for any metal where all required TMFs are provided. &nbsp; If metal concentrations are not supplied (warning), DGVs will be calculated, but a bioavailable concentration and hazard quotient *will not* be calculated for those rows.
